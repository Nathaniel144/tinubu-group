            A Little Background About Our Presidential Candidate
          </h2>
          <h3 class="anim2">Bola Ahmed Tinubu</h3>
          <p class="anim2">
            Bola Ahmed Adekunle Tinubu (born 29 March 1952) is a Nigerian
            accountant and politician who served as the Governor of Lagos State
            from 1999 to 2007 and Senator for Lagos West during the brief Third
            Republic. In June 2022, he was chosen as the All Progressives
            Congress nominee in the 2023 Nigerian presidential election. Tinubu
            spent his early life in southwestern Nigeria and later moved to
            United States where he studied Accounting at Chicago State
            University. He returned to Nigeria in the early 1980s and was
            employed by Mobil Nigeria as an accountant, before entering politics
            as a Lagos West senatorial candidate in 1992 under the banner of the
            Social Democratic Party. In the first post-transition Lagos State
            gubernatorial election, Tinubu won by a wide margin as a member of
            the Alliance for Democracy over the Peoples Democratic Party's Dapo
            Sarumi and the All People's Party's Nosirudeen Kekere-Ekun. Four
            years later, he won re-election to a second term over the PDP's
            Funsho Williams by a reduced margin. Tinubu's two terms were marked
            by attempts at modernizing the city of Lagos and his feuds with the
            PDP-controlled federal government. After leaving office in 2007, he
            since played a key role in the formation of the All Progressives
            Congress in 2013.

                In 1999, under military rule, Lagos was generating N600,000
                monthly. Today, the internally generated revenue (IGR) is around
                N45 billion.
